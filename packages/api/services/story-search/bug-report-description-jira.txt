h2. Summary

The MariaDB optimizer does not use vector indexes for queries with {{ORDER BY VEC_DISTANCE_*}} and {{LIMIT}}, even when the index exists and is properly defined. The optimizer performs a full table scan ({{type=ALL, key=NULL}}) instead of using the vector index, and this behavior persists even when using {{FORCE INDEX}} hints.

h2. Environment

* MariaDB Version: 11.8.5-MariaDB-ubu2404
* Storage Engine: InnoDB
* Table Size: Tested with both small tables (3 rows) and production tables (667k rows)

h2. Steps to Reproduce

# Create a table with a vector column and vector index:
{code:sql}
CREATE TABLE test_vector_index_bug (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  v vector(10) NOT NULL,
  VECTOR KEY (v)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
{code}

# Insert test data:
{code:sql}
INSERT INTO test_vector_index_bug (v) VALUES
  (vec_fromtext('[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0]')),
  (vec_fromtext('[0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.1]')),
  (vec_fromtext('[0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.1,1.2]'));
{code}

# Verify the index exists:
{code:sql}
SHOW INDEX FROM test_vector_index_bug WHERE Key_name = 'v';
-- Shows: Index_type='VECTOR' ✓
{code}

# Run a query that should use the vector index:
{code:sql}
SET @test_vector = vec_fromtext('[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0]');

EXPLAIN 
SELECT id, VEC_DISTANCE_COSINE(v, @test_vector) as similarity
FROM test_vector_index_bug
ORDER BY VEC_DISTANCE_COSINE(v, @test_vector)
LIMIT 5;
{code}

# Try with FORCE INDEX:
{code:sql}
EXPLAIN 
SELECT id, VEC_DISTANCE_COSINE(v, @test_vector) as similarity
FROM test_vector_index_bug FORCE INDEX (v)
ORDER BY VEC_DISTANCE_COSINE(v, @test_vector)
LIMIT 5;
{code}

h2. Expected Behavior

According to MariaDB documentation, queries with {{ORDER BY VEC_DISTANCE_*}} and {{LIMIT}} should use the vector index. The EXPLAIN output should show:
* {{type=index}} or {{type=range}}
* {{key=v}} (the vector index name)
* Estimated rows should be much lower than the table size

h2. Actual Behavior

EXPLAIN shows:
* {{type=ALL}} (full table scan)
* {{key=NULL}} (no index used)
* {{rows=3}} (or full table size for larger tables)

This occurs even with:
* {{FORCE INDEX (v)}} hint
* {{USE INDEX (v)}} hint
* {{ANALYZE TABLE}} to update statistics
* Recreating the index with explicit parameters ({{M=8, DISTANCE=cosine}})

h2. Impact

* *Performance:* Vector similarity searches perform full table scans instead of using the optimized vector index
* *Scalability:* Query performance degrades linearly with table size instead of logarithmically
* *Functionality:* Vector indexes are effectively non-functional for their intended use case

h2. Additional Information

* Vector functions ({{vec_fromtext}}, {{VEC_DISTANCE_COSINE}}) work correctly
* The vector index is created successfully and appears in {{SHOW INDEX}}
* The issue occurs even on tables with just 3 rows, indicating it's not a statistics/cost estimation problem
* Related issue: [MDEV-35305|https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-35305] (but that issue shows the index IS used, just slow log reports incorrectly - this is a different, more severe issue)

h2. Test Case

See attached file: {{vector-index-bug-reproduction-minimal.sql}}

h2. Workaround

None available. Must perform full table scans for vector similarity searches, which severely impacts performance on large tables.
